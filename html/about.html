            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>
                I'm Darragh, a 19 year old software developer studying
                <a class="about-link" href="https://software-engineering.ie"
                    >Immersive Software Engineering</a
                >
                at the University of Limerick.

                <br /><br />
                I have always been intruiged by computers and the underlying
                concepts that make them work. When I was about 13 or 14, I
                learned touch typing, then took it upon myself to learn how to
                program.

                <br /><br />

                I started with Python, and quickly familiarised myself with core
                concepts, conventions, and paradigms. I conducted my own
                research by reading books and articles and by watching YouTube
                videos, then tested my knowledge by creating whatever
                mini-projects I could think of.

                <br /><br />

                When I was in my penultimate year of secondary school, I took
                Computer Science as one of my subjects. There, I learned a wide
                variety of computer science theory, and was able to refresh my
                knowledge on Python.

                <br /><br />

                We went on to learn about web development, creating projects
                using HTML, CSS, and Javascript. I took an interest in
                everything I learned, often spending my free time refreshing or
                expanding my knowledge, learning about NodeJS, Sass, and various
                Python libraries I found interesting. I quickly realised how
                vast the world of computing is, further captivating my
                inquisitive nature.

                <br /><br />

                My learning spree continues to this day, and I have become an
                all-round efficient programmer, having acquired back-end and
                front-end knowledge and experience. As it stands, I am more
                interested in back-end development, particularly low-level
                systems programming. My preferred languages are Python, C++, C,
                and Rust.

                <br /><br />

                So far in college I have studied a wide range of topics,
                including but not limited to:
